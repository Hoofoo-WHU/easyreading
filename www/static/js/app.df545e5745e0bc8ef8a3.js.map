<p>“秋是一个歌，但是‘桂花蒸’的夜，像在厨里吹的箫调，白天像小孩子唱的歌，又热又熟又清又湿。”</p>\n\n      <p>——炎樱丁阿小手牵着儿子百顺，一层一层楼爬上来。高楼的后阳台上望出去，城市成了旷野，苍苍的无数的红的灰的屋脊，都是些后院子，后窗，后巷堂，连天也背过脸去了，无面目的阴阴的一片，过了八月节还这么热，也不知它是什么心思。</p>\n\n      <p>下面浮起许多声音，各样的车，拍拍打地毯，学校*R*R摇铃，工匠捶着锯着，马达嗡嗡响，但都恍惚得很，似乎都不在上帝心上，只是耳旁风。</p>\n\n      <p>公寓中对门邻居的阿妈带着孩子们在后阳台上吃粥，天太热，粥太烫，撮尖了嘴唇凋嗤凋嗤吹着，眉心紧皱，也不知是心疼自己的嘴唇还是心疼那雪白的粥。对门的阿妈是个黄脸婆，半大脚，头发却是剪了的。她忙着张罗孩子们吃了早饭上学去，她耳边挂下细细一绺子短发，湿腻腻如同墨画在脸上的还没干。她和阿小招呼：“早呀，妹妹！”孩子们纷纷叫：“阿姨，早！”阿小叫还一声“阿姐！”百顺也叫：“阿姨！阿哥！”</p>\n\n      <p>阿小说：“今天来晚了——断命电车轧得要死，走过头了才得下来。外国人一定揿过铃了！”对门阿妈道：“这天可是发痴，热得这样！”阿小也道：“真发痴！都快到九月了呀！”</p>\n\n      <p>刚才在三等电车上，她被挤得站立不牢，脸贴着一个高个子人的蓝布长衫，那深蓝布因为肮脏到极点，有一种奇异的柔软，简直没有布的劲道；从那蓝布的深处一蓬一蓬慢慢发出它内在的热气。这天气的气味也就像那袍子——而且绝对不是自己的衣服，自己的脏又还脏得好些。</p>\n\n      <p>阿小急急用钥匙开门进去，先到电铃盒子前面一看，果然，二号的牌子掉了下来了。主人昨天没在家吃晚饭，让她早两个钟头回去，她猜着他今天要特别的疙瘩，作为补偿。她揭开水缸的盖，用铁匙子舀水，灌满一壶，放在煤气炉上先烧上了。战时自来水限制，家家有这样一个缸，酱黄大水缸上面描出淡黄龙。女人在那水里照见自己的影子，总像是古美人，可是阿小是个都市女性，她宁可在门边绿粉墙上粘贴着的一只缺了角的小粉镜<span class=\"quote\">（本来是个皮包的附属品）</span>里面照了一照，看看头发，还不很毛。她梳辫子头，脑后的头发一小股一小股恨恨地扭在一起，扭绞得它完全看不见了为止，方才觉得清爽相了。额前照时新的样式做得高高的，做得紧，可以三四天梳一梳。她在门背后取下白围裙来系上，端过凳子，踩在上面，在架子上拿咖啡，因为她生得矮小。</p>\n\n      <p>“百顺——又往哪里跑？这点子工夫还惦记着玩！还不快触祭了上学去！”她叱喝。她那秀丽的刮骨脸凶起来像晚娘。</p>\n\n      <p>百顺脸团团地，细眉细眼，陪着小心，把一张板凳搬到门外，又把一只饼干筒抱了出去，坐在筒上，凳上放了杯盘，静静等着。阿小从冰箱上的瓦钵子里拿出吃剩的半只大面包，说：</p>\n\n      <p>“哪！拿去！有本事一个人把它全吃了！——也想着留点给别人。没看见的，这点大的小孩，吃得比大人还多！”</p>\n\n      <p>窗台上有一只蓝玻璃杯，她把里面插着的牙刷拿掉了，热水瓶里倒出一杯水，递与百顺，又骂：“样样要人服侍！你一个月给我多少工钱，我服侍你？前世不知欠了你什么债！还不吃了快走！”</p>\n\n      <p>百顺嘴里还在咀嚼，就去拿书包。突然，他对于他穿了一夏天的泛了灰的蓝布工人装感到十分疲倦，因此说：“姆妈，明天我好穿绒线衫了。”阿小道：“发什么昏！这么热的天，绒线衫！”</p>\n\n      <p>百顺走了她叹了口气，想着孩子的学校真是难伺候。学费加得不得了，此外这样那样许多花头，单只做手工，红绿纸金纸买起来就吓人。窗台上，酱油瓶底下压着他做的一个小国旗，细竹签上挑出了青天白日满地红。阿小侧着头，看了一眼，心中只是凄凄惨惨不舒服。</p>\n\n      <p>才把咖啡煮了，大银盘子端整好了，电话铃响起来。阿小拿起听筒，撇着洋腔锐声说：“哈罗？……是的密西，请等一等。”她从来没听见过这女人的声音。又是个新的。她去敲敲门：“主人，电话！”</p>\n\n      <p>主人已经梳洗过了，穿上衣服了，那样子是很不高兴她。</p>\n\n      <p>主人脸上的肉像是没烧熟，红拉拉的带着血丝子。新留着两撇小胡须，那脸蛋便像一种特别滋补的半孵出来的鸡蛋，已经生了一点点小黄翅。但是哥儿达先生还是不失为一个美男子。非常慧黠的灰色眼睛，而且体态风流。他走出来接电话，先咳嗽一声，可是喉咙里还有些混浊。他问道：“哈罗？”然后，突然地声音变得极其微弱：“哈罗哦！”又惊又喜，销魂地，等于说：“是你么？难道真的是你么？”他是一大早起来也能够魂飞魄散为情颠倒的。</p>\n\n      <p>然而阿小，因为这一声迷人的“哈罗哦！”听过无数遍了，她自管自走到厨房里去。昨天“黄头发女人”请客，后来想必跟了他一起回来的，因为厨房里有两只用过的酒杯，有一只上面腻着口红。女人不知什么时候走的？他那些女人倒是从来不过夜的。女人去了之后他一个人到厨房里吃了个生鸡蛋，阿小注意到洋铁垃圾桶里有个完整的鸡蛋壳，他只在上面凿一个小针眼，一吸——阿小摇摇头，简直是野人呀！冰箱现在没有电，不应当关上的，然而他拿了鸡蛋顺手就关严了。她一开，里面冲出一阵甜郁的恶气。她取出乳酪，鹅肝香肠，一只鸡蛋。哥儿达除了一顿早饭在家里吃，其余两顿总是被请出去的时候多。冰箱里面还有半碗“杂碎”炒饭，他吃剩的，已经有一个多扎拜了。她晓得他并不是忘记了，因为他常常开冰箱打探情形的。他不说一声“不要了，你把它吃掉罢，”她也决不去问他“还要不要了？”她晓得他的脾气。</p>\n\n      <p>主人挂上电话，检视备忘录上阿妈写下的，他不在家的时候人家打了来，留下的号码；照样打了去，却打不通。他伸头到厨房里，曼声叫：“阿妈，难为情呀！数目字老是弄不清楚！”竖起一只手指警戒地摇晃着。阿小两手包在围裙里，脸上露出于红的笑容。</p>\n\n      <p>他向她孩子吃剩的面包瞟了一眼，阿小知道他起了疑心，其实这是隔壁东家娘有多余的面包票给了她一张，她去买了来的。主人还没有做声，她先把脸飞红了。苏州娘姨最是要强，受不了人家一点点眉高眼低的，休说责备的话了。尤其是阿小生成这一副模样，脸一红便像是挨了个嘴巴子，薄薄的面颊上一条条红指印，肿将起来。她整个的脸型像是被凌虐的，秀眼如同剪开的两长条，眼中露出一个幽幽的世界，里面“沉鱼落雁，闭月羞花”。</p>\n\n      <p>主人心中想道：“再要她这样的一个人到底也难找，用着她一天，总得把她哄得好好的。”因此并不查问，只说：“阿妈，今天晚上预备两个人的饭。买一磅牛肉。”阿小说：“先煨汤，再把它炸一炸？”主人点点头。阿小说：“还要点什么呢？”主人沉吟着，一手支在门框上，一手撑腰；他那双灰色眼睛，不做媚眼的时候便翻着白眼，大而瞪，瞪着那块吃剩的面包，使阿小不安。他说：“珍珠米，也许？”她点头，说：</p>\n\n      <p>“珍珠米。”每次都是同样的菜，好在请的是不同的女人，她想。他说：“还要一样甜菜，摊两个煎饼好了。”阿小道：“没有面粉。”他说：“就用鸡蛋，不用面粉也行。”甜鸡蛋阿小从来没听见过这样东西，但她还是熟溜地回答：“是的主人。”</p>\n\n      <p>她把早饭送到房里去，看见小橱上黄头发女人的照片给收起来了。今天请的想必就是那新的女人，平常李小姐她们来他连照片也不高兴拿开。李小姐人最厚道，每次来总给阿小一百块钱。阿小猜她是个大人家的姨太太，不过也说不准，似乎太自由了些，而且不够好看——当然姨太太也不一定都好看。</p>\n\n      <p>阿小又接了个电话：“哈罗？……是的密西，请等一等。”</p>\n\n      <p>她敲门进去，说：“主人，电话。”主人问是谁。她说“李小姐。”主人不要听，她便替他回掉了：“哥儿达先生她在浴间里！”阿小只有一句“哈罗”说得最漂亮，再往下说就有点乱，而且男性女性的“他”分不大清楚。“对不起密西，也许你过一会再打来？”那边说：“谢谢。”她答道：“不要提。再会密西。”</p>\n\n      <p>哥儿达先生吃了早饭出去办公，临走的时候照例在房门口柔媚地叫唤一声：“再会呀，阿妈！”只要是个女人，他都要使她们死心塌地喜欢他。阿妈也赶出来带笑答应：“再会主人！”她进去收拾房间，走到浴室里一看，不由得咬牙切齿恨了一声。哥儿达先生把被单枕套衬衫裤大小毛巾一齐泡在洗澡缸里，不然不放心，怕她不当天统统洗掉它。今天又没有太阳，洗了怎么得干？她还要出去买菜，公寓里每天只有一个钟头有自来水，浴缸被占据，就误了放水的时间，而他每天要洗澡的。</p>\n\n      <p>李小姐又打电话来。阿小说：“哥儿达先生她去办公室！”</p>\n\n      <p>李小姐改用中文追问他办公室的电话号码，阿小也改口说中文：“李小姐是吧？”笑着，满面绯红，代表一切正经女人替这个女人难为情。“我不晓得他办公室的电话什么号头。</p>\n\n      <p>……</p>\n\n      <p>他昨天没有出去。……是的，在家里吃晚饭的。……一个人吃的。今天不知道，没听见他说……“</p>\n\n      <p>黄头发的女人打电话来，要把她昨天大请客问哥儿达借的杯盘刀叉差人送还给他。阿小说：“哥儿达先生她去办公室！</p>\n\n      <p>……是的密西。我是阿妈。……我很好，谢谢你密西。“”黄头发女人“声音甜得像扭股糖，到处放交情，阿小便也和她虚情假意的、含羞带笑，仿佛高攀不上似的。阿小又问：“什么时候你派来阿妈？现在我去菜场，九点半回来也许。……</p>\n\n      <p>谢谢你密西。……不要提，再会密西。“她逼尖了嗓子，发出一连串火炽的聒噪，外国话的世界永远是欢畅，富裕，架空的。</p>\n\n      <p>她出去买了小菜回来。“黄头发女人”的阿妈秀琴，也是她自家的小姊妹，是她托哥儿达荐了去的，在后面拍门，叫：</p>\n\n      <p>“阿姐！阿姐！”秀琴年纪不过二十一二，壮大身材，披着长长的鬈发也不怕热，蓝布衫上还罩着件玉绿兔子呢短大衣。能够打扮得像个大学女生，显然是稀有的幸运。就连她那粉嘟嘟的大圆脸上，一双小眼睛有点红红地睁不大开<span class=\"quote\">（不知是不是痧眼的缘故）</span>，好像她自己也觉得有一种鲜华，像蒙古妇女从脸上盖着的沉甸甸的五彩缨络缝里向外界窥视。</p>\n\n      <p>阿小接过她手里报纸包的一大叠盘子，含笑问了一声：</p>\n\n      <p>“昨天几点钟散的？”秀琴道：“闹到两三点钟。”阿小道：“东家娘后来到我们这里来了又回去，总天亮以后了。”秀琴道：</p>\n\n      <p>“哦，后来还到这里来的？”阿小道：“好像来过的。”她们说到这些事情，脸上特别带着一种天真的微笑，好像不在说人的事情。她们那些男东家是风，到处乱跑，造成许多灰尘，女东家则是红木上的雕花，专门收集灰尘，使她们一天到晚揩拭个不了。她们所抱怨的，却不在这上头。</p>\n\n      <p>秀琴两手合抱在胸前，看阿小归折碗盏，嘟囔道：“我们东家娘同这里的东家倒是天生的一对，花钱来得个会花，要用的东西一样也不舍得买。那天请客，差几把椅子，还是问对门借的。面包不够了，临时又问人家借了一碗饭。”阿小道：</p>\n\n      <p>“那她比我们这一位还大方些。我们这里从来没说什么大请过客，请起来就请一个女人，吃些什么我说给你听：一块汤牛肉，烧了汤捞起来再煎一煎算另外一样。难末，珍珠米。</p>\n\n      <p>客人要是第一次来的，还有一样甜菜，第二次就没有了。……</p>\n\n      <p>他有个李小姐，实在吃不惯，菜馆里叫了菜给他送来。李小姐对他真是天地良心！他现在又搭上新的了。我看他一个不及一个，越来越不在乎了。今天这一个连哥儿达的名字都说不连牵。“秀琴道：“中国人么？“阿小点头，道：“中国人也有个几等几样……妹妹你到房里来看看李小姐送他的生日礼，一副银碗筷，晓得他喜欢中国东西，银楼里现打的，玻璃盒子装着，玻璃上贴着红寿字。“秀琴看着，啧啧叹道：</p>\n\n      <p>“总要好几千？”阿小道：“不止！不止！”</p>\n\n      <p>这时候出来一点太阳，照在房里，像纸烟的烟的迷迷的蓝。榻床上有散乱的彩绸垫子，床头有无线电，画报杂志，床前有拖鞋，北京红蓝小地毯，宫灯式的字纸篓。大小红木雕花几，一个套着一个。墙角挂一只京戏的鬼脸子。桌上一对锡蜡台。房间里充塞着小趣味，有点像个上等白俄妓女的妆阁，把中国一些枝枝叶叶衔了来筑成她的一个安乐窝。最考究的是小橱上的烟紫玻璃酒杯，各式各样，吃各种不同的酒；齐齐整整一列酒瓶，瓶口加上了红漆蓝漆绿漆的蛋形大木塞。</p>\n\n      <p>还有浴室里整套的淡黄灰玻璃梳子，逐渐地由粗齿到细齿，七八只一排平放着，看了使人心痒痒的难过，因为主人的头发已经开始脱落了，越是当心，越觉得那珍贵的头发像眼睫毛似的，梳一梳就要掉的。</p>\n\n      <p>墙上用窄银框子镶着洋酒的广告，暗影里横着个红头发白身子，长大得可惊的裸体美女，题着“一城里最好的”。和这牌子的威士忌同样是第一流。这美女一手撑在看不见的家具上，姿势不大舒服，硬硬地支拄着一身骨骼，那是冰棒似的，上面凝冻着冰肌。她斜着身子，显出尖翘翘的圆大乳房，夸张的细腰，股部窄窄的；赤着脚但竭力踮着脚尖仿佛踏在高跟鞋上。短而方的“孩儿面”，一双棕色大眼睛愣愣地望着画外的人，不乐也不淫，好像小孩子穿了新衣拍照，甚至于也没有自傲的意思；她把精致的乳房大腿蓬头发全副披挂齐整，如同时装模特儿把店里的衣服穿给顾客看。</p>\n\n      <p>她是哥儿达先生的理想，至今还未给他碰到过。碰到了，他也不过想占她一点便宜就算了。如果太麻烦，那也就犯不着；他一来是美人迟暮，越发需要经济时间与金钱，而且也看开了，所有的女人都差不多。他向来主张结交良家妇女，或者给半卖淫的女人一点业余的罗曼史，也不想她们劫富济贫，只要两不来去好了。他深知“久赌必输”，久恋必苦的道理，他在赌台上总是看看风色，趁势捞了一点就带了走，非常知足。</p>\n\n      <p>墙上挂着这照片式的画，也并不秽亵，等于展览着流线型的汽车，不买看看也好，阿小与秀琴都避免朝它看，不愿显得她们是乡下上来的，大惊小怪。</p>\n\n      <p>阿小道：“趁着有水，我有一大盆东西要洗呢，妹妹你坐一歇。——天下就有这样痴心的女人！”她还在那里记挂李小姐，弯倒腰，一壁搓洗，一壁气喘吁吁说：“会得喜欢他！</p>\n\n      <p>他一个男人，比十个女人还要小奸小坏。隔壁东家娘多下一张面包票，我领了一只面包来，他还当是他的，一双眼睛瞄法瞄法。偷东西也偷不到他头上！他呀，一个礼拜前吃剩下来一点饭还留到现在，他不说不要了，我也不动他的。‘上海这地方坏呀！中国人连佣人都会欺负外国人！’他要是不在上海，外国的外国人都要打仗去的，早打死了！——上次也是这样，一大盆衣服泡在水里，怕我不洗似的，泡得衬衫颜色落得一塌胡涂，他这也不说什么了——看他现在愈来愈烂污，像今天这个女人——怎么能不生病？前两个月就弄得满头满脸疖子似的东西，现在算好了，也不知抹的什么药，被单上稀脏。“</p>\n\n      <p>秀琴半天没搭话，阿小回头看看，她倚在门上咬着指头想心思。阿小这就记起来，秀琴的婆家那边要讨了，她母亲要领她下乡去，她不肯。便问：“你姆妈还在上海么？”秀琴亲亲热热叫了一声“阿姐！”说道：“我烦死了在这里！”她要哭，水汪汪的温厚红润的眼睛完全像嘴唇了。</p>\n\n      <p>阿小道：“我看你，去是要去的。不然人家说你，这么大的姑娘，一定是在上海出了花头。”秀琴道：“姆妈也这样说呀！去是要去的，去一去我就来，乡下的日子我过不惯！姆妈这两天起劲得很在那里买这样买那样，闹死了说贵，我说你叽咕些什么，棉被枕头是你自己要撑场面，那些绣花衣裳将来我在上海穿不出去的。我别的都不管，他们打的首饰里头我要一只金戒指。这点礼数要还给我们的。你看喏，他们拿只包金的来，你看我定规朝地下一掼！你看我做得出口伐？”</p>\n\n      <p>她的尊贵骄矜使阿小略略感到不快。阿小同她的丈夫不是“花烛”，这些年来总觉得当初不该就那么住在一起，没经过那一番热闹。她说：“其实你将就些也罢了。不比往年——你叫他们哪儿弄金子去？”想说两句冷话也不行，伛偻在澡盆边，热得恍恍惚惚，口鼻之间一阵阵刺痛冒汗，头上的汗往下直流，抬手一抹，明知天热，还是诧异着。她蹲得低低的，秀琴闻得见她的黑拷绸衫上的汗味阵阵上升，像西瓜剖开来清新的腥气。</p>\n\n      <p>秀琴又叹息。“不去是不行的了！他们的房子本来是泥地，单单把新房里装了地板……我心里烦得要死！听说那个人好赌呀——阿姐你看我怎么好？“</p>\n\n      <p>阿小把衣服绞干了，拿到前面阳台上去晒，百顺放学回来，不敢揿铃，在后门口大喊：“姆妈！姆妈！”拍着木栅栏久久叫唤，高楼外，正午的太阳下，苍淡的大城市更其像旷野了。一直等阿小晾完了衣裳，到厨房里来做饭，方才听见了，开门放他进来，嗔道：“叽哩哇啦叫点什么？等不及似的！”</p>\n\n      <p>她留秀琴吃饭，又来了两个客，一个同乡的老妈妈，常喜欢来同阿小谈谈天，别的时候又走不开，又不愿总是叨扰人家，自己带了一篮子冷饭，诚诚心心爬了十一层楼上来。还有个背米兼做短工的“阿姐”，是阿小把她介绍了给楼下一家洗衣服。她看见百顺，问道：“这就是你自己的那一个？”阿小对孩子叱道：“喊‘阿姨’！”慢回娇眼，却又脸红红的向朋友道歉似地说：“像个瘪三哦？”</p>\n\n      <p>现在这时候，很少看得见阿小这样的热心留人吃饭的人。</p>\n\n      <p>她爱面子，很高兴她今天刚巧吃的是白米饭。她忙着炒菜，老妈妈问起秀琴办嫁妆的细节。秀琴却又微笑着，难得开口，低着粉红的脸像个新嫁娘。阿小一一代她回答了，老妈妈也有许多意见。</p>\n\n      <p>做短工的阿姐问道：“你们楼上新搬来的一家也是新做亲的？”阿小道：“嗳。一百五十万顶的房子，男家有钱，女家也有钱——那才阔呢！房子，家生，几十床被窝，还有十担米，十担煤，这里的公寓房子那是放也放不下！四个佣人陪嫁，一男一女，一个厨子，一个三轮车夫。”那四个佣人，像丧事里纸扎的童男童女，一个一个直挺挺站在那里，一切都齐全，眼睛黑白分明。有钱人做事是漂亮！阿小愉快起来——这样一说，把秀琴完全压倒了，连她的忧愁苦恼也是不足道的。</p>\n\n      <p>阿姐又问：“结了亲几天了？”阿小道：“总有三天了罢？”</p>\n\n      <p>老妈妈问：“新法还是老法？”阿小道：“当然新法。不过嫁妆也有，我看见他们一抬盒一抬盒往上搬。”秀琴也问：“新娘子好看么？”阿小道：“新娘子倒没看见。他们也不出来，上头总是静得很，一点声音都没有。”阿姐道：“从前还是他们看房子的时候我看见的，好像蛮胖，戴眼镜。”阿小仿佛护短似的，不悦道：“也许那不是新娘子。”</p>\n\n      <p>老妈妈捧了一碗饭靠在门框上，叹道：“还是帮外国人家，清清爽爽！”阿小道：“阿呀！现在这个时世，倒是宁可工钱少些，中国人家，有吃有住；像我这样，名叫三千块钱一个月，光是吃也不够！——说是不给吃，也看主人。像对过他们洋山芋一炒总有半脸盆，大家就这么吃了。”百顺道：“姆妈，对过他们今天吃干菜烧肉。”阿小把筷子头横过去敲一下，叱道：“对过吃的好，你到对过吃去！为什么不去？啊？为什么不去？”百顺目夹了目夹眼，没哭出来，被大家劝住了。阿姐道：</p>\n\n      <p>“我家两个瘪三，比他大，还没他机灵哩！”凑过去亲昵地叫一声：“瘪三！”故意凶他：“怎么不看见你扒饭？菜倒吃了不少，饭还是这么一碗！”阿小却又心疼起来，说：“让他去罢！</p>\n\n      <p>不尽着他吃，一会儿又闹着要吃点心了。“又向百顺催促：</p>\n\n      <p>“要吃趁现在，待会随你怎么闹也没有了。”</p>\n\n      <p>老妈妈问百顺：“吃了饭不上学堂么？”阿小道：“今天礼拜六。”回过头来一把抓住百顺：“礼拜六，一钻就看不见你的人了？你好好坐在这里读两个钟头书再去玩。”百顺坐在饼干筒上，书摊在凳上，摇摆着身体，唱道：“我要身体好，身体好！爸爸妈妈叫我好宝宝，好宝宝！”读不了两句便问：</p>\n\n      <p>“姆妈，读两个钟头我好去玩了？姆妈，现在几点啊？”</p>\n\n      <p>阿小只是不理。秀琴笑道：“百顺一条喉咙真好听，阿姐你不送他去学说书，赚大钱？”阿小怔了一怔，红了脸，淡淡笑了一声道：“他不行罢？小学毕业还早呢。虽然他不学好，我总想他读书上进呀！”秀琴道：“几年级了？”阿小道：“才三年级。留班呀！难为情哦！”她看看百顺，心头涌起寡妇的悲哀。她虽然有男人，也赛过没有，全靠自己的。百顺被她睃那一眼，却害怕起来，加紧速度摇摆唱念：“我要身体好，身体好……”</p>\n\n      <p>老妈妈道：“这天真奇怪，就不是闰月，平常九月里也该渐渐冷了。”百顺忽然想起，抬头笑道：“姆妈，天冷的时候我要买个嘴套子，先生说嘴套子好，不会伤风！”阿小突然一阵气往上冲，骂道：“亏你还有脸先生先生的！留了班还高高兴兴！你高兴！你高兴！”</p>\n\n      <p>在他身上拍打了两下，百顺哭起来，老妈妈连忙拉劝道：“算了算了，这下子工夫打了他两回了。”</p>\n\n      <p>阿小替百顺擤擤鼻涕，喝道：“好了，不许哭了，快点读！”</p>\n\n      <p>百顺抽抽噎噎小声念书，忽然欢叫起来：“姆妈，阿爸来了！”</p>\n\n      <p>阿爸来了姆妈总是高兴的，连他也沾光。客人们也知道，阿小的男人做裁缝，宿在店里，夫妻难得见面，极恩爱的。大家打个招呼，寒暄几句，各各告辞了。阿小送到后门口，说：</p>\n\n      <p>“来白相！”百顺也跟在后面说：“阿姨来白相呵！”</p>\n\n      <p>阿小的男人抱着白布大包袱，穿一身高领旧绸长衫。阿小给他端了把椅子坐着，太阳渐渐晒上身来，他依旧翘着腿抱着膝盖坐定在那里。下午的大太阳贴在光亮的，闪着钢锅铁灶白瓷砖的厨房里像一块滚烫的烙饼。厨房又小，没地方可躲。阿小支起架子来熨衣裳，更是热烘烘的。她给男人斟了一杯茶；她从来不偷茶的，男人来的时候是例外。男人双手捧着茶慢慢呷着，带一点微笑听她一面熨衣裳一面告诉他许多话。他脸色黄黄的，额发眉眼都生得紧黑机智，脸的下半部却不知为什么坍了下来；刨牙，像一只手似地往下伸着，把嘴也坠下去了。</p>\n\n      <p>她细细告诉他关于秀琴的婚事，没有金戒指不嫁，许多排场。他时而答应一声“唔，”</p>\n\n      <p>狡猾的黑眼睛望着茶，那微笑是很明白的，很同情的，使她伤心；那同情又使她生气，仿佛全是她的事——结婚不结婚本来对于男人是没什么影响的。同时她又觉得无味，孩子都这么大了，还去想那些。男人不养活她，就是明媒正娶一样也可以不养活她。谁叫她生了劳碌命。他挣的钱只够自己用，有时候还问她要钱去入会。</p>\n\n      <p>男人旋过身去课子，指着教科书上的字考问百顺。阿小想起来，说：“我姆妈有封信来，有两句文话我不大懂。”“吴县县政府”的信封，“丁阿小女仕玉展”，左角还写着“呈祥”字样。男人看信，解释给她听：</p>\n\n      <p class=\"yinwen\">信通知。母在乡。一切智悉。近想女在沪。贵体康安。诸事迪吉。目下。女说。到十月。要下来。千吉。交女带点三日头药。下来。望你。收信。千定不可失误。者。乡下。近日。十分安乐。望女。不必远念。者再吾母。交女。一件。绒线衫。千定带下。不要望纪。倘有。不下来。速寄。有便之人。不可失约。余言不情。特此面谈可也。<br />\n      <span class=\"sgntr\">九月十四日母王玉珍寄</span></p>\n\n      <p>乡下来的信从来没有提到过她的男人，阿小时常叫百顺代她写信回去，那边信上也从来不记挂百顺。念完了信，阿小和她男人都有点寂寥之感。男人默坐着，忽然为他自己辩护似地，说起他的事业：“除了做衣裳，我现在也做点皮货生意。目前的时世，不活络一点不行的。”他打开包袱，抖开两件皮大衣给她过目，又把个皮统子兜底掏出来，说：“所以海獭这样东西……”叙述海獭的生活习惯，原是说给百顺听。百顺撒娇撒痴，不知什么时候已经离开书本，偎在阿小身边，一只手伸到她衣服里找寻口袋，哼哼唧唧，纠缠不休。阿小非常注意地听她丈夫说话，听得出神：“唔……唔……哦哦……噢……嗳……”男人下了结论：“所以海里的东西真是奇怪。”</p>\n\n      <p>阿小一时没有适当的对答，想了一想，道：“现在小菜场上乌贼很多了。”男人道：“唔。乌贼鱼这东西也非常奇怪。你没看见过大的乌贼，比人还大，一身都是脚爪，就像蜘蛛……”阿小皱起面皮，道：“真的么！吓死人了。”向百顺道：</p>\n\n      <p>“呜哩呜哩吵点什么！……说什么！听不见！……发痴了！我哪里来五块钱给你！”然而她随即摸出钱来给了他。</p>\n\n      <p>熨完了衣裳，阿小调了面粉摊煎饼，她和百顺名下的户口粉，户口糖。男人也有点觉得无功受禄，背着手在她四面转来转去，没话找话说。父子两个趁热先吃了，她还继续摊着。</p>\n\n      <p>太阳黄烘烘照在三人脸上，后阳台的破竹帘子上飞来一只蝉，不知它怎么夏天过了还活着，趁热大叫：“抓！抓！抓！”</p>\n\n      <p>响亮快乐地。</p>\n\n      <p>主人回来了，经过厨房门口，探头进来柔声唤：“哈罗，阿妈！”她男人早躲到阳台上去了，负手看风景。主人花三千块钱雇了个人，恨不得他一回来她就驯鸽似地在他头上乱飞乱啄，因此接二连三不断地揿铃，忙得她团团转。她在冰箱里取冰，她男人立在她身后，低声说：“今天晚上我来。”阿小嫌烦似地说：“热死了！”她和百顺住的那个亭子间实在像个蒸笼。——但她忽然又觉得他站在她背后，很伶仃似的；他是不惯求人的——至于对她他从来没有求告过。……她面对着冰箱银灰色的肋骨，冰箱的构造她不懂，等于人体内脏的一张爱克斯光照片，可是这冰箱的心是在突突跳着，而里面喷出的一阵阵寒浪熏得她鼻子里发酸，要出眼泪了。她并不回头，只补上一句：“百顺还是让他在对过过夜好了。他们阿妈同小孩子都住在这里的。”男人说：“唔。”</p>\n\n      <p>她送冰进房出来，男人已经去了。她下楼去拎了两桶水上来，打发主人洗了澡。门铃响，那新的女人如约来了。阿小猜是个舞女。她问道：“外国人在家么？”一路扭进房去。脑后一大圈鬈发撅出来老远，电烫得枯黄虬结，与其他部分的黑发颜色也不同，像个皮围脖子，死兽的毛皮，也说不上来这东西是死的是活的，一颤一颤，走一步它在后面跳一跳。</p>\n\n      <p>阿小把鸡尾酒和饼干送进去。李小姐又来了电话。阿小回说主人不在家。李小姐这次忍不住有嗔怪的意思，质问道：</p>\n\n      <p>“我早上打电话来你有没有告诉他？”阿小也生气了——从来还没有谁对于她的职业道德发生疑问，她淡淡地笑道：“我告诉他的呀！不晓得他可是忘记了呢！怎么，他后来没有打得来么？”李小姐顿了一顿，道：“没有呀，”声音非常轻微。阿小心想：谁叫你找上来的，给个佣人刻薄两句！但是她体念到李小姐每次给的一百块钱，就又婉媚地替哥儿达解释，随李小姐相信不相信，总之不使她太下不来台：“今天他本来起晚了，来不及地赶了出去，后来在行李间，恐怕又是忙，又是人多，打电话也不方便……”李小姐“唔，唔，”地答应着，却仿佛在那边哭泣着了。阿小道：“那么，等他回来了我再告诉他一声。”李小姐仿佛离得很远很远地，隐隐地道：“你也不要同他说了……”可是随即又转了口：“过天我有空再打来罢。”她仿佛连这阿妈都舍不得撒手似的，竟和她攀谈起来。</p>\n\n      <p>她上次留心到，哥儿达的床套子略有点破了，他一个独身汉，诸事没人照管，她意思要替他制一床新的。阿小这时候也有点嫌这李小姐婆婆妈妈讨厌，又要替主人争面子，便道：“他早说了要做新的，因为这张床是顶房子时候顶来的，也不大合意，一直想重买一只大些的；如果就这只床上做了套子，尺寸又不对了。现在我替他连连，也看不出来了。”她对哥儿达突然有一种母性的卫护，坚决而厉害。</p>\n\n      <p>正说着，哥儿达伸头出来探问，阿小忙向李小姐道：“听电梯响不晓得是不是他回来了呢！”一面按住听筒轻声告诉哥儿达。哥儿达皱了皱眉，走出来了，却向里指指，叫阿小进去把酒杯茶点收出来。他接过听筒，且不坐下来，只望墙上一靠，叉着腰，戒备地问道：“哈罗？……是的，这两天忙。……不要发痴！哪有的事？”那边并没有炸起来，连抽搭抽搭的哭声也一口气吸了进去听不见了。他便消闲下来，重又低声笑道：“不要发痴了……你好么？“正好呢喃耳语着，万一房里那一个在那里注意听。”你那股票我已经托他买了。看你的运气！这一向头痛毛病没有发么？睡得还好？“他向电话里”嘘！嘘！“吹口气，使那边耳朵里一阵奇痒。也许他从前常在她耳根下吹口气作耍的，两人都像是旧梦重温，格格地笑起来。他又道：“那么，几时可以看见你呢？“说到幽会，是言归正传，他马上声音硬化起来，丁是丁，卯是卯的。</p>\n\n      <p>“星期五怎么样？……这样好不好，先到我这里来再决定。”如果先到他这里来，一定就是决定不出去了，在家吃晚饭。他一只手整理着卷曲的电话线，一壁俯身去看桌上一本备忘簿上阿妈写下来的，记错了的电话号码——她总是把９字写反过来。</p>\n\n      <p>是谁打了来的呢？不会是……但这阿妈真是恼人！他粗声回答电话里：“……不，今天我要出去。我现在不过回来换件衣服就要走的。……”然而他又软了下来，电话上谈到后来应当是余音袅袅的。他道：“所以……那么，一直要到星期五！”</p>\n\n      <p>微喟着。叮咛着：“当心你自己。拜拜，甜的！”末了一句仿佛轻轻的一吻。</p>\n\n      <p>阿小进去收拾阳台上一张藤桌上的杯盏，女人便倚着铁栏杆。对于这年轻的舞女，这一切都是新鲜浪漫的罢？傍晚的城中起了一层白雾，雾里的黄包车紫阴阴地远远来了，特别地慢，慢慢过去一辆；车灯，脚踏车的铃声，都收敛了，异常轻微，仿佛上海也是个紫禁城。</p>\n\n      <p>楼下的阳台伸出一角来像轮船头上。楼下的一个少爷坐在外面乘凉，一只脚蹬着栏干，椅子向后斜，一晃一晃，而不跌倒，手里捏一份小报，虽然早已看不见了。天黑了下来；地下吃了一地的柿子菱角。阿小恨不得替他扫扫掉——上上下下都是清森的夜晚，如同深海底。黑暗的阳台便是载着微明的百宝箱的沉船。阿小心里很静也很快乐。</p>\n\n      <p>她去烧菜，油锅拍辣辣爆炸，她忙得像个受惊的鸟，扑来扑去。先把一张可以折叠的旧式大菜台搬进房去，铺上台布，汤与肉先送进去，再做甜菜。甜鸡蛋到底不像话，她一心软，给他添上点户口面粉，她自己的，做了鸡蛋饼。</p>\n\n      <p>她和百顺吃的是菜汤面疙瘩，一锅淡绿的粘糊，嘟嘟煮着，面上起一点肥胖的颤抖。百顺先吃完了，走到后阳台上，一个人自言自语：“月亮小来！星少来！”</p>\n\n      <p>阿小诧异道：“瞎说点什么？”笑起来了，“什么‘月亮小来，星少来’？发痴滴搭！”</p>\n\n      <p>她进去收拾碗盏，主人告诉她：“待会儿我们要出去。你等我们走了，替我铺了床再走。”阿小答应着，不禁罕异起来——这女人倒还有两手，他仿佛打算在她身上多花几个钱似的！</p>\n\n      <p>她想等临走的时候再把百顺交给对过的阿妈，太早了怕他们嫌烦。烧开了两壶水，为百顺擦脸洗脚，她自己也洗脚，洗脖颈。电话铃响，她去接：“哈罗？”那边半天没有声音。</p>\n\n      <p>她猜是个中国人打错了的，越发仿着个西洋悍妇的口吻，火高三丈锐叫一声“哈罗？”那边怯怯地说：“喂？阿妈还在吗？”</p>\n\n      <p>原来是她男人，已经等了她半天了。“十点钟了，”他说。</p>\n\n      <p>阿小听听主人房里还是鸦雀无声。百顺坐在饼干筒上盹着了。下起雨来了，竹帘子上淅沥淅沥，仿佛是竹竿梦见了它们自己从前的叶子。她想：“这样子倒好，有了个借口。”她喊醒了百顺，领他走到隔壁去，向对过阿妈解释：“下雨，不带他回去了，小人怕他滑跌跤，又喜欢伤风，跟着阿姨睡一晚罢！”回到这边来，主人还是没有动静，她火冒起来，敲门没人理，把门轻轻推开一线，屋里漆黑的，不知什么时候已经双双出去了。阿小忍着气，替他铺了床。她自己收拾回家，拿了钥匙网袋雨伞，短大衣舍不得淋湿，反折着挽在手里，开后门下楼去。</p>\n\n      <p>雨越下越大。天忽然回过脸来，漆黑的大脸，尘世上的一切都惊惶遁逃，黑暗里拼铃碰隆，雷电急走。痛楚的青，白，紫，一亮一亮，照进小厨房，玻璃窗被逼得往里凹进去。</p>\n\n      <p>阿小横了心走过两条马路，还是不得不退回来，一步拖一步走上楼来，摸到门上的锁，开了门，用网袋包着手开了电灯，头上身上黑水淋漓。她把鞋袜都脱了，白缎鞋上绣的红花落了色，红了一鞋帮。她挤掉了水，把那双鞋挂在窗户钮上晾着。光着脚踏在砖地上，她觉得她是把手按在心上，而她的心冰冷的像石板。厨房内外没有一个人，哭出声来也不要紧。</p>\n\n      <p>她为她自己突如其来的癫狂的自由所惊吓，心里模糊地觉得不行，不行！不能一个人在这里，快把百顺领回来罢。</p>\n\n      <p>她走到隔壁去，幸喜后门口还没上闩，厨房里还点着灯。她一直走进去，拍拍玻璃窗，哑着喉咙叫：“阿姐！开开门！”对过阿妈道：“咦？你还没回去么？”阿小带笑道：“不好走呀！</p>\n\n      <p>雨太大，现在这断命路又没有灯！马路上全是些坑，坑里全是水——真要命！想想还是在这里过夜罢。我那瘪三困了没有？还是让他跟我睡去罢。“</p>\n\n      <p>对过阿妈道：“你有被头在这里么？”阿小道：“有的有的。”</p>\n\n      <p>她把棉被铺在大菜台上，下面垫了报纸，熄了灯，与百顺将就睡下。厨房里紧小的团圆暖热里生出两只苍蝇来，在头上嗡嗡飞鸣。雨还是哗哗大下。忽地一个闪电，碧亮的电光里又出了一个蜘蛛，爬在白洋瓷盆上。</p>\n\n      <p>楼上的新夫妇吵起嘴来了，訇訇响，也不知是蹬脚，还是人被推操着跌到橱柜或是玻璃窗上。女人带着哭声哩哩罗罗讲话，仿佛是扬州话的“你打我！……你打我！……你打死我啊！”阿小在枕上倾听，心里想：“一百五十万顶了房子来打架！才结婚了三天，没有打架的道理呀！……除非是女人不规矩……”她朦胧中联想到秀琴的婆家已经给新房里特别装上地板，秀琴势不能不嫁了。</p>\n\n      <p>楼上闹闹停停，又闹起来。这一次的轰轰之声，一定是女人在那里开玻璃门，像是要跳楼，被男人拖住了。女人也不数落了，只是放声嚎哭。哭声渐低，户外的风雨却潮水似地高起来，呜呜叫嚣，然后又是死寂中的一阵哭闹，再接着一阵风声雨声，各不相犯，像舞台上太显明地加上去的音响效果。</p>\n\n      <p>阿小拖过绒线衫来替百顺盖盖好，想起从前同百顺同男人一起去看电影，电影里一个女人，不知怎么把窗户一推，就跨了出去；是大风雨的街头，她歪歪斜斜在雨里奔波，无论她跑到哪里，头上总有一盆水对准了她浇下来。阿小苦恼地翻了个身，在枕头那边，雨还是哗哗下，一盆水对准了她浇下来。她在雨中睡着了。</p>\n\n      <p>将近午夜的时候，哥儿达带了女人回来，到厨房里来取冰水。电灯一开，正照在大菜台上，百顺睡梦里唔唔呻吟，阿小醒了，只做没醒。她只穿了件汗衫背心，条纹布短裤，侧身向里，瘦小得像青蛙的手与腿压在百顺身上，头上的两只苍蝇，叮叮地朝电灯泡上撞。哥儿达朝她看了一眼。这阿妈白天非常俏丽有风韵的，卸了装却不行。他心中很觉安慰，因为他本来绝对没有沾惹她的意思；同个底下人兜搭，使她不守本分，是最不智的事。何况现在特殊情形，好的佣人真难得，而女人要多少有多少。</p>\n\n      <p>哥儿达捧了一玻璃盆的冰进去。女人在房里呵呵笑着，她喝下的许多酒在人里面晃荡晃荡，她透明透亮地成了个酒瓶，香水瓶，躺在一个盒子的淡绿碎鬈纸条里的贵重的礼物。门一关，笑声听不见了，强烈的酒气与香水香却久久不散。厨下的灯灭了，苍蝇又没头没脑扑上脸来。</p>\n\n      <p>雨仿佛已经停了好一会。街上有人慢悠悠叫卖食物，四个字一句，不知道卖点什么，只听得出极长极长的忧伤。一群酒醉的男女唱着外国歌，一路滑跌，嘻嘻哈哈走过去了；沉沉的夜的重压下，他们的歌是一种顶撞，轻薄，薄弱的，一下子就没有了。小贩的歌，却唱彻了一条街，一世界的烦忧都挑在他担子上。</p>\n\n      <p>第二天，阿小向开电梯的打听楼上新娘子为什么半夜三更寻死觅活大闹。开电梯的诧异道：“哦？有这事么？今天他们请客，请女家的人，还找了我去帮忙哩。”还是照样地请了客。</p>\n\n      <p>阿小到阳台上晾衣服，看见楼下少爷昨晚乘凉的一把椅子还放在外面。天气骤冷，灰色的天，街道两旁，阴翠的树，静静的一棵一棵，电线杆一样，没有一点胡思乱想。每一株树下团团围着一小摊绿色的落叶，乍一看如同倒影。</p>\n\n      <p>乘凉仿佛是隔年的事了。那把棕漆椅子，没放平，吱格吱格在风中摇，就像有个标准中国人坐在上头。地下一地的菱角花生壳，柿子核与皮。一张小报，风卷到阴沟边，在水门汀栏杆上吸得牢牢地。阿小向楼下只一瞥，漠然想道：天下就有这么些人会作脏！好在不是在她的范围内。</p>\n\n      <p class=\"date\">（一九四四年九月）</p>\n    </div>\n
